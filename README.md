# Section 1 - General Community Policies
These are the general policies which you agree to by joining our community.

## 1.1 - Discrimination
We do not support discrimination of any forms in the Archcord community. This includes transphobia, homophobia, xenophobia, racism and other non described forms of discrimination. This is an inclusive community and if you are found to be discriminating against a group of people in the Archcord community may result in punishment at a moderators discression.

**Punishment Escalation Procedure:**

For first cases of discrimination, for example backhanded comments, members will be brought into tickets and asked to correct their behaviour. Failure to comply may result in removal from the Archcord community.

For severe first cases or repeat cases, bans will be issued to members who show discriminitory behaviour. This includes slurs and explicit discrimination.


## 1.2 - Age Requirements
By joining the Archcord community you agree that you are at least 13 years old as per the Discord Terms of Service. However, this does not mean that you can make explicit jokes due to members in the server being over 13. Please refer to Rule 1.3.

**Punishment Escalation Procedure:**

If you are found to be under 13, you will be banned from the community for at minimum 3 years. There are no exceptions to this ban and it cannot be appealed.


## 1.3 - Safe for Work Environment
We would like to keep Archcord a safe environment for all and so as part of that we do not want any content considered Sexually Explicit or Not Safe For Work in our community. 

### 1.3.1 - Sexually Explicit Messages
- Any messages sent by members must be safe for work. Explicit content must not be shared through images, videos or similar.

### 1.3.2 - Sexually Explicit User Profiles
- User profiles which are viewable in this community must conform to our safe for work guidelines and must be suitable for a community with minors.

### 1.3.3 - Animal Abuse, Gore and Excessive Violence.
- Do not share content which has animal abuse, gore or an excessive amount of violence.

### 1.3.4 - Self Harm and Suicide
- Content which depicts self harm, or suicide is not accepted in this community and will be removed. Using self-harm for manipulative purposes will result in immediate removal from the community.
  
**Punishment Escalation Procedure:**

On first offences, members who post offending content will be ticketed, unless at moderators discression posted content is deemed severe at which a moderator holds the right to remove a member from the community effective immediately, see Rule 2.1.
For continued offences, moderators may timeout, mute, kick or ban members depending on severity and severity and frequency of the content posted.

## 1.4 - Anti Elitism
Elitism is not acceptable in the Archcord community. No distribution is better than the other and our goal here is to help out newer members of the linux community. Telling members to "RTFM" or "Read the Fucking Manual" is not acceptable and will result in a ticket and potential punishment.

**Punishment Escalation Procedure:**

Members will be ticketed on their first offences and their behaviour will be brought up. Continued instances of this behaviour may result in removal from the community.

## 1.5 - Cross-Server Drama
At Archcord we like to keep a friendly community with a lack of politics and so as part of that we would like to keep drama from other communities out of our community.

**Punishment Escalation Procedure:**

The first case of cross server drama may result in a ticket and a member being corrected on their behaviour. Continued offences may result in removal from the community.

## 1.6 - Personally Identifiable Information
Members must not share other members personal information, this includes real names if the member does not wish for it to be shared, phone numbers, emails, addresses, locations and other information of sensitivity.

**Punishment Escalation Procedure:**

Depending on severity a member may be ticketed or removed from the community effective immediately.

## 1.7 - Discussion of piracy.
As per the Discord Terms of Service, piracy must not be promoted in Archcord. While it is a discussable topic, we ask that you do not share sources, resources or links. If you do discuss piracy, please do it carefully as if a moderator deems your conversation to contain sources/links removal from the community is possible.

**Punishment Escalation Procedure:**

Depending on severity a member may be ticketed or removed from the community effective immediately.

# Section 2 - Moderation Policies
These are the moderation policies which the stafff team follow and you adknowledge by joining our community.

## 2.1 - Moderator Discression
Moderators hold the power to remove members, with good reason, from the community at any time. However, as a member you hold the power to communicate with the moderation team if you disagree with a staff members punishment. Moderator Discression does not mean a staff member can remove any member they want for any reason and if misconduct is found a staff member may be removed.

## 2.2 - Moderation Transparency
At Archcord, we hold an open policy regarding moderation with all our moderation logs publicly viewable by all members in our community allowing members to criticise punishments for any reason they see fit. We ask that community members open this in a ticket channel instead of the general channels to prevent community disruption.

## 2.3 - Administrator Insuitability
If the community deems an administrator to be unfit at any point, they must retract from their position and allow the community to vote on a fit successor. A 30-day window between the administrator being removed and the new administrator coming into effect, where the previous administrator retains power is used to allow the community time to decide on a new administrator. For this policy to go through, at minimum 90% of the **TOTAL** community must agree in a public poll to this going ahead. For example if the community consists of 1000 members, 900 must agree to this.
