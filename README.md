## Preface <a name="preface"></a>

By joining the Archcord community, you agree to follow this Code of Conduct as it exists at the time of joiningâ€”and as it is updated over time. You also agree to comply with Discord's [Terms of Service](https://discord.com/terms) and [Community Guidelines](https://discord.com/guidelines). Failure to comply may result in your removal from our community.

---

## Section 1 - General Community Policies <a name="section-1---general-community-policies"></a>

These policies ensure a safe and respectful environment for all our members.

### 1.1 - Discrimination <a name="11---discrimination"></a>

We do not tolerate any form of discrimination, including transphobia, homophobia, xenophobia, racism, and other similar behaviors. Our community is inclusive, and any discriminatory actions may result in moderation action.

**Punishment Escalation:**
- **First Offense (Mild):** You will receive a private ticket explaining the issue and guidance for improvement.
- **Severe or Repeated Offenses:** You may be banned immediately, especially for the use of slurs or overt discrimination.

---

### 1.2 - Age Requirements <a name="12---age-requirements"></a>

By joining, you confirm that you are at least 13 years old as per Discord's Terms of Service. Note that being 13 or older does not permit explicit or adult jokes given our diverse age group.

**Punishment Escalation:**
- **Underage Members:** If you are found to be under 13, you will be banned for a minimum of 3 years with no possibility of appeal.

---

### 1.3 - Safe for Work Environment <a name="13---safe-for-work-environment"></a>

We aim to maintain a Safe For Work (SFW) space for everyone. This includes guidelines for all forms of shared content:

#### 1.3.1 - Sexually Explicit Messages
- **Guideline:** All messages must be safe for work. Explicit content (images, videos, etc.) is prohibited.

#### 1.3.2 - Sexually Explicit User Profiles
- **Guideline:** Profile content must remain appropriate for a community that includes minors.

#### 1.3.3 - Animal Abuse, Gore, and Excessive Violence
- **Guideline:** Do not share content depicting animal abuse, graphic gore, or excessive violence.

#### 1.3.4 - Self-Harm and Suicide
- **Guideline:** Content related to self-harm or suicide is not allowed. Using such topics manipulatively will result in immediate removal.

**Punishment Escalation:**
- **First Offense:** You may receive a ticket unless the content is deemed severe, in which case a moderator may remove you immediately.
- **Repeated Offenses:** Further violations may lead to timeouts, mutes, kicks, or bans.

---

### 1.4 - Anti-Elitism <a name="14---anti-elitism"></a>

Elitist behavior is not acceptable. Dismissing newcomers with comments like "RTFM" or "Read the Fucking Manual" undermines our community spirit.

**Punishment Escalation:**
- **First Offense:** You will be ticketed, and your behavior will be addressed.
- **Repeated Offenses:** Continued behavior may result in removal from the community.

---

### 1.5 - Cross-Server Drama <a name="15---cross-server-drama"></a>

We strive to keep our community drama-free by avoiding issues from other servers.

**Punishment Escalation:**
- **First Instance:** You may receive a ticket and a warning.
- **Repeated Instances:** Continued behavior can lead to removal.

---

### 1.6 - Personally Identifiable Information <a name="16---personally-identifiable-information"></a>

Do not share personal information about others (e.g., real names, phone numbers, emails, addresses) without explicit consent.

**Punishment Escalation:**
- Depending on the severity, you may be ticketed or removed immediately.

---

### 1.7 - Discussion of Piracy <a name="17---discussion-of-piracy"></a>

While discussions around piracy may occur, promoting or sharing sources, resources, or links related to piracy is prohibited.

**Punishment Escalation:**
- Depending on severity, you may be ticketed or removed immediately.

---

### 1.8 - Bot Commands <a name="18---bot-commands"></a>

Please use designated channels for bot commands to ensure clear conversation flow.

**Punishment Escalation:**
- Depending on severity, you may receive a ticket.

---

## Section 2 - Voice Activity Conduct <a name="section-2---voice-activity-conduct"></a>

Voice channels have more relaxed guidelines but still require respectful behavior.

### 2.1 - Music Bot Trolling <a name="21---music-bot-trolling"></a>

Interrupting music sessions (e.g., mass skipping or altering the queue) is not allowed. Please wait your turn or use a separate voice channel.

**Punishment Escalation:**
- Depending on severity, you may be ticketed or removed.

---

### 2.2 - Sound Spam <a name="22---sound-spam"></a>

Spamming soundboard clips or audio in voice channels disrupts conversation and is prohibited.

**Punishment Escalation:**
- Depending on severity, you may be ticketed.

---

### 2.3 - Streamed Content <a name="23---streamed-content"></a>

All streamed content must comply with our SFW policies and piracy guidelines. Streaming content you haven't legally purchased is not allowed.

**Punishment Escalation:**
- Depending on severity, you may be ticketed or removed.

---

## Section 3 - Moderation Policies <a name="section-3---moderation-policies"></a>

By joining Archcord, you acknowledge our moderation practices.

### 3.1 - Moderator Discretion <a name="31---moderator-discretion"></a>

Moderators have the authority to remove members for valid reasons. However, you have the right to communicate if you disagree with a decision. Moderators must exercise their discretion fairly.

---

### 3.2 - Moderation Transparency <a name="32---moderation-transparency"></a>

All moderation logs are publicly viewable to maintain transparency. If you have concerns or need clarifications, please open a ticket rather than discussing in general channels.

---

### 3.3 - Administrator Unsuitability <a name="33---administrator-unsuitability"></a>

If the community deems an administrator unfit, a public vote will be held. A 30-day transition period is provided during which the outgoing administrator remains until a successor is elected. For this process to proceed, at least **90% of the total community** must agree via poll.

---

### 3.4 - Administrator Privilege <a name="34---administrator-privilege"></a>

Administrators may remove any member deemed unfit for the community, even if they are following the Code of Conduct. This power is not absolute and can be challenged. However, sensitive matters may require administrators to withhold specific details.
